## Remarks  
 The formula is validated and its results calculated, but is not applied to the pool.  To apply the formula to the pool, use [Microsoft.Azure.Batch](assetId:///N:Microsoft.Azure.Batch?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True).  
  
 This method does not change any state of the pool, and does not affect the [LastModified](assetId:///P:Microsoft.Azure.Batch.CloudPool.LastModified?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) or [ETag](assetId:///P:Microsoft.Azure.Batch.CloudPool.ETag?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True).  
  
 The evaluate operation runs asynchronously.
