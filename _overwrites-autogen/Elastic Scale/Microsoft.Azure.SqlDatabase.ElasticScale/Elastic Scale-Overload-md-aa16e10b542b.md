## Remarks  
 The default retry behavior has a built-in set of exceptions that are considered transient.              You may create and use a custom [Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale](assetId:///N:Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) object in order              to treat additional exceptions as transient.
