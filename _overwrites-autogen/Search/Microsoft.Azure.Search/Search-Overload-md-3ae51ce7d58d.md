## Remarks  
 The non-generic overloads of the Suggest, SuggestAsync, and SuggestWithHttpMessagesAsync methods make a             best-effort attempt to map JSON types in the response payload to .NET types. See             [Microsoft.Azure.Search](assetId:///N:Microsoft.Azure.Search?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) for more information.  
  
## Remarks  
 The generic overloads of the Suggest, SuggestAsync, and SuggestWithHttpMessagesAsync methods support             mapping of Azure Search field types to .NET types via the type parameter T. See              [IDocumentsOperations Interface](assetId:///T:Microsoft.Azure.Search.IDocumentsOperations?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) for more details on the type mapping.
