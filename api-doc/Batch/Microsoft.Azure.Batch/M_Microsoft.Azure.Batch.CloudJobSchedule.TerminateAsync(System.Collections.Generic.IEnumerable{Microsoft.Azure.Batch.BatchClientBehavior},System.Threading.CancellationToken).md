## Remarks  
 The terminate operation requests that the job schedule be terminated.  The request puts the schedule in the [Microsoft.Azure.Batch](assetId:///N:Microsoft.Azure.Batch?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) state.             The Batch service will wait for any active job to terminate, and perform the actual job schedule termination without any further client action.  
  
 The terminate operation runs asynchronously.
