## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Microsoft recommends that you call asynchronous methods in your code whenever possible for optimal performance. The recommended methods are those that use the Async/Await pattern. For more information about asynchronous programming in .NET with Async/Await, see [Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await (C# and Visual Basic)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh191443.aspx).  
>   
>  The corresponding method that uses Async/Await is [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob](assetId:///N:Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True).
